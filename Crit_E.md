## Suggestions for Future Development
### Enhanced Subscription Features

To provide our different user tiers more effectively, it would be beneficial to develop additional features for each subscription level. This might include higher audio quality for premium subscribers or more personalized music recommendations. Enabling these could improve user satisfaction and potentially increase subscription upgrades.

### Social Media Integration

Expanding the social media integration to include more platforms would allow users a wider range of options for easy account access and sharing of playlists. The integration process should be streamlined to encourage social sharing and increase platform engagement.

### Improved Playlist Collaboration

Introducing more collaborative playlist features, where users can add songs to a shared playlist, would likely enhance the community feel of the platform. Additionally, allowing users to set collaborative playlists as public or private can provide flexibility in how they interact with others on the service.

### Miles System Expansion

Given the popularity of the miles system, introducing tiered rewards or milestones could provide users with more short-term goals, encouraging continuous engagement. A clear and transparent system for tracking and redeeming miles would also be valuable.

### Artist Discovery Portal

The 'Create' section for artists has been well-received. To further support upcoming artists, a dedicated portal that showcases their profiles and music to users could be implemented. This would not only aid in artist discovery but also diversify the content available to listeners.

### User Feedback Mechanisms

Lastly, implementing a better feedback system, where users can easily suggest features or report issues, would be a great option. This direct line of communication between users and developers can help future developments.
